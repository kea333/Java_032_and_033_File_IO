        "All our programs up to this point have been able to store data in variables, so the data is either on the stack or on the heap. However, the moment the program ends, the data is lost. Neither the stack or heap are **persistent** storage. When we restart the program, none of the data is available any more. Real programs need data that has been input or generated to survive the program closing, so we can carry on where we left off. We might be saving the state of a game, a wordprocessor document, or a program being developed. The file system of the computer provides persistent storage. To do this we need file input and output. Data is written into a file and then can be read in by the program at a later date, or by a different person. \n",

A comma separated file is an example of this, where values to go in a record are together on the same line of the file, separated by commas. This means those values can easily be separated out using the method split and then stored in the appropriate fields of a record variable."
